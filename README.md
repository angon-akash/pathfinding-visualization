# Pathfinding Visualization

A simple and interactive visualization tool for popular pathfinding algorithms. This project demonstrates how different algorithms explore a grid to find the shortest path between two points.

## Features

- Visualizes popular pathfinding algorithms:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* Search Algorithm
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Interactive grid: set start/end points and walls
- Step-by-step or instant visualization
- Clean and simple UI

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/angon-akash/pathfinding-visualization.git
    cd pathfinding-visualization
    ```

2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser. No additional setup or
   dependencies are required.

## Usage

- Click on the grid to set the **start** and **end** points.
- Draw walls by clicking and dragging on the grid.
- Select an algorithm and start the visualization.
- Watch as the algorithm finds the shortest path!
