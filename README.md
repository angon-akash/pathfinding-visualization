# pathfinding-visualization
This project is an interactive visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm implemented using Pygame. It allows users to create a custom grid environment with walls and obstacles, set starting and ending positions, and observe how the A* algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path between these points.
